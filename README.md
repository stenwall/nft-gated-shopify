# NFT token gated Shopify for Smircs

Toked gate specific products in [Smircs'](https://smircs.mademo.se/) Shopify store.

---

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [thirdweb React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react)
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)

## Getting started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template cra-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

In `src/index.js`, you'll find the `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for thirdweb's [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.
