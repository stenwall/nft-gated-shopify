# NFT token gated Shopify

Toked gate specific products in Shopify store.

---

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [thirdweb React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react)
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)

## Getting started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

In `src/main.tsx`, you'll find the `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for thirdweb's [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.
